## Context

<p>Churn rate is a marketing metric that describes the number of customers who leave a business over a specific time period. Every user is assigned a prediction value that estimates their state of churn at any given time. This value is based on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User demographic information</li>
  <li>Browsing behavior</li>
  <li>Historical purchase data among other information</li>
</ul>

<p>It factors in our unique and proprietary predictions of how long a user will remain a customer. This score is updated every day for all users who have a minimum of one conversion. The values assigned are between 1 and 5.</p>
